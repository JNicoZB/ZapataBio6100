### 1 

Suppose x = 1.1, a = 2.2, and b = 3.3. Assign each expression to the value of the variable z and print the value stored in z.

𝑥𝑎𝑏
(𝑥𝑎)𝑏
3𝑥3+2𝑥2+1

``` {r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# First, assign the values to x, a and b
x <- 1.1
a <- 2.2
b <- 3.3 

# Create a vector with the formula
z <- x^(a^b)
print(z)
z <- (x^a)^b
print(z)
z <- 3*(x^3)+2*(x^2)+1
print(z)

```


### 2

Using the rep and seq functions, create the following vectors:
a. (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)
b. (1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5)
c. (5,4,4,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
my_vector1 <- c(seq(from=1 , to=8), seq(from=7, to=1)) 
print(my_vector1)
my_vector2 <- c(rep(1:5,1:5))
print(my_vector2)
my_vector3 <- c(rep(5:1,1:5))
print(my_vector3)

```
Use the function seq to create the sequence and rep to determine how many times the the numbers repeat 

### 3

Create a vector of two random uniform numbers. In a spatial map, these can be interpreted as x and y coordinates that give the location of an individual (such as a marked forest tree in a plot that has been mapped). Using one of R’s inverse trigonometry functions (asin(), acos(), or atan()), convert these numbers into polar coordinates

``` {r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
vector3 <- runif(2)
print(vector3)
asin(vector3)
acos(vector3)
atan(vector3)

```


### 4

Create a vector queue <- c("sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant") where queue represents the animals that are lined up to enter Noah’s Ark, with the sheep at the front of the line. Using R expressions, update queue as:

the serpent arrives and gets in line;
the sheep enters the ark;
the donkey arrives and talks his way to the front of the line;
the serpent gets impatient and leaves;
the owl gets bored and leaves;
the aphid arrives and the ant invites him to cut in line.
Finally, determine the position of the aphid in the line.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
queue <- c("sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant")
print(queue)
queue <- c(queue, "serpent")
print(queue)
queue <- queue[queue !="sheep"]
print(queue)
#other way
queue[c(1,2)]
queue[-c(1)]
print(queue)

queue <- c("donkey", queue)
print(queue)
queue <- queue[queue !="serpent"]
print(queue)
queue <- queue[queue !="owl"]
print(queue)
queue <- c(queue[1:2], "aphid", queue[3])  
print(queue)
position <- which(queue == "aphid")
print(position)



```


### 5

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
z <- seq(1,100) 
print(z)

z <- 1:100
print(z)
filtered_numbers <- z[which(z %% 2 != 0 & z %% 3 != 0 & z %% 7 != 0)]
print(filtered_numbers)

```
Generate a sequence from 1 to 100. Use "%%" to determine the remainder when each number is divided.
